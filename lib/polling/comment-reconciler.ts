/**
 * Comment reconciliation (polling safety net).
 *
 * Instagram webhooks are best-effort and never fire for a large class of
 * comments (collapsed "load more" comments, non-follower / low-signal accounts,
 * anything Instagram filters). Those comments are otherwise invisible: never
 * replied to, never DM'd.
 *
 * This sweep is deliberately narrow. For each active campaign it looks only at
 * that campaign's post, only at recent comments, and acts on a comment ONLY when
 * both are true:
 *   1. the comment matches the campaign keyword, and
 *   2. the account owner has not already replied to it.
 * The reply check reads the comment's actual replies on Instagram, so a comment
 * you (or the tool) already answered is skipped — the poll never re-touches
 * handled comments. Each sweep is capped so it can never flood the comment API
 * (which Instagram rate-limits aggressively, error 368).
 *
 * It runs on an interval in the worker process because Vercel's free crons only
 * fire once a day. Matching and sending reuse the worker's processComment, so
 * rate limiting and logging behave exactly as for webhook-delivered comments.
 *
 * Known limitation, handled not fixed: comments removed by Instagram's Hidden
 * Words / spam filter may not be returned by the Graph API at all. Disable that
 * filter on the account to widen results.

/**
 * How many times to attempt the DM for one comment. One. Not a retry budget —
 * a statement about what Instagram allows.
 *
 * The window for a private reply is 7 days, and the earlier version of this
 * constant read that as "failure is rarely permanent, so retry for a while".
 * That confused the window with the budget. Instagram allows exactly ONE
 * private reply per comment. The first attempt spends it whether it succeeds,
 * fails, or fails ambiguously; every attempt after that comes back as code 100
 * subcode 2534001, which reads like "this person cannot be reached" and is
 * actually "you already used your one shot on them".
 *
 * The numbers from 2026-09-05 are unambiguous. Of 107 deliveries, 95 landed on
 * the first attempt. Of every 2534001 refusal, NOT ONE was a first attempt —
 * the earliest was attempt four. Retrying never recovered a single person; it
 * only converted people we had probably already reached into people we had
 * definitely annoyed, because Meta returns code 1 on sends that did deliver
 * (216 of those in 24 hours) and we read each one as a reason to send again.
 *
 * For somebody with no DM history the private reply is the only door, so
 * burning it costs the whole contact. Someone with an existing thread survived
 * our retries only because they had a second door. That asymmetry is the whole
 * reason "people who never messaged me get nothing" looked like a platform
 * restriction rather than a bug on our side.
 *
 * One attempt. If it does not land, postUnreachableNudge asks them publicly to
 * DM the keyword, which opens a thread from their side — the only route left.
